# Sneaker Price Premium Prediction
-----------------------
This end-to-end machine learning project focuses on evaluating various models on their predictive capability for determining the return on investment/resale price premium for Yeezy and Off-White sneakers. Such a model can be exploited by entrepreneurs in determining which sneakers to target and when to sell them for optimal profits. This individual assignment is part of the UCL course MSIN0097 Predictive Analytics.

The data incorporated into this report is sourced from the StockX data contest run in 2019 and can be accessed at the link: [StockX Competition](https://stockx.com/news/the-2019-data-contest/). Furthermore, manually compiled colour data for each shoe was collected. 

The following machine learning models were investigated:
- Linear Regression
- Elastic Net
- Linear Support Vector Machine Regressor 
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Voting Regressor

The findings of the study, identify the Random Forest model to be the best performing with an R<sup>2</sup> score of just over **97%** on the test set. Therefore it seems that machine learning models can offer resellers a valuable estimate of the potential return on investment for certain sneakers.
